This script creates a voice-activated assistant capable of performing various tasks such as answering questions, searching the web, providing insights via OpenAI, and more. Here's a brief overview:

Imported Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries for handling date and time, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, web browsing, querying Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha, keyboard input, mathematical operations, and accessing OpenAI.
Loading Credentials: It loads credentials, such as API keys, using the dotenv library.
Google Text-to-Speech (TTS): Initializes the Google TTS client for converting text to speech using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech service.
Muting ALSA Errors: Mutes ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) errors to prevent them from being printed to the console.
Parameters and Configuration: Sets up parameters such as activation words and the type of TTS engine.
Initialization of Speech Engines and Clients: Initializes local speech engine and Google TTS client.
Functions: Defines functions for various tasks such as converting text to speech, parsing user commands, searching Wikipedia, querying Wolfram Alpha, and querying OpenAI for insights.
Main Loop: Listens for user commands, processes them, and performs corresponding actions based on the commands. Actions include speaking greetings, answering questions, searching Wikipedia, querying Wolfram Alpha, taking notes, and exiting the program.
